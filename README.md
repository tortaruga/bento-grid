## Overview

i thought it would be more complicated to get the layout since i usually have trouble with css grid, but this time it was easier and it didnt take as long

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

## My process

i started with the mobile design first, then adjested the grid for bigger screens

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

this makes the text scale with the screen without having it be too small on small screens: 

```
font-size: calc(2.5rem + 1vw);
```

this way the font will never be smaller than 2.5rem


### Continued development

i will try to get better at judging sizes and getting the design as close as possible as the solution.
